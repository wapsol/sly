# Run Sly on Android with Termux

Sly runs on Android through [Termux](https://termux.dev/), a terminal emulator and Linux environment. Text input, file tools, and shell commands are supported. Sly can copy and paste text through the Android clipboard with Termux:API. Clipboard image paste is not supported.

## Before you begin

Install Termux from [GitHub or F-Droid](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#installation). Do not use the deprecated Google Play build.

[Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api#installation) is optional. Install it only when you want Sly to copy or paste Android clipboard text, or when shell commands need Android device APIs.

## Install Sly

1. Update Termux packages:

   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```

2. Install Node.js and Git:

   ```bash
   pkg install nodejs git
   ```

3. Install Sly:

   ```bash
   npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
   ```

4. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   sly --version
   ```

5. Open the folder you want to work in and start Sly:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/working-folder
   sly
   ```

Continue with the main [Quickstart](quickstart.md#3-choose-a-model) to connect a model and run your first task.

## Access Android shared storage

Termux cannot access shared Android storage until you grant permission. Run this once:

```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

After approval, Android shared storage is available under `/storage/emulated/0` and through the links Termux creates under `~/storage/`.

Only grant this permission when Sly should be able to access those files. Commands and tools running in Termux use the same storage permissions as the Termux process.

## Use clipboard commands

Sly uses `termux-clipboard-set` to copy text and `termux-clipboard-get` for its clipboard-paste shortcut. Shell commands can use both commands directly. Install the Termux:API app and its command-line package:

```bash
pkg install termux-api
```

Verify the integration:

```bash
printf 'Sly clipboard test' | termux-clipboard-set
termux-clipboard-get
```

The second command should print `Sly clipboard test`.

The Termux clipboard API supports text only. Sly's clipboard-paste shortcut inserts that text into the editor but cannot attach clipboard images.

## Add Termux-specific instructions

Sly detects that it is running in Termux, but it cannot infer how you want it to interact with Android. Add only the environment details relevant to your work to `~/.sly/agent/AGENTS.md`:

````markdown
# Termux environment

- Sly runs in Termux on Android.
- Shared Android storage is under `/storage/emulated/0`.
- Open URLs with `termux-open-url "https://example.com"`.
- Open files with `termux-open <path>`.
- Do not access shared storage unless the task requires it.
````

Run `/reload` after changing the file during an active session.

## Troubleshooting

### Clipboard integration fails

Confirm that you installed both components:

1. The Termux:API Android app from the same source as Termux
2. The `termux-api` command-line package

Then run the clipboard verification commands above outside Sly. If they fail there, fix the Termux:API installation before retrying Sly's copy command.

### Shared storage reports permission denied

Run `termux-setup-storage`, approve the Android permission request, and retry the path under `~/storage/` or `/storage/emulated/0`.

### Sly is not found after installation

Open a new Termux shell and run:

```bash
npm prefix -g
command -v sly
```

Confirm that the global npm binary directory is on `PATH`, then reinstall Sly if the package is missing.
