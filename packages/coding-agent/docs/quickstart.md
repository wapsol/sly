# Quickstart

Sly runs in your terminal and works with files on your machine. To use it, you need access to a model through a supported provider. This can be a subscription, an API key, or a local model.

For native Windows setup, read [Windows Setup](windows.md). For Android, read [Termux Setup](termux.md).

## 1. Install Sly

On macOS or Linux, you can use the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, install Sly from npm. This requires Node.js 22.19 or newer:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Sly does not require dependency lifecycle scripts for a normal npm installation.

Verify the installation:

```bash
sly --version
```

## 2. Start Sly

Change to the folder you want Sly to work with, then start it:

```bash
cd /path/to/folder
sly
```

The working folder helps Sly discover relevant files, instructions, and configuration. Sly also uses it to group saved sessions.

The interface shows your conversation, an editor for prompts and commands, and a footer with the current folder, model, and session status. See [Use Sly in the terminal](usage.md) to learn how to add files, run commands, direct ongoing work, and manage results.

## 3. Choose a model

A **model** generates Sly's responses. A **provider** is the service or account Sly uses to access that model.

In Sly, run:

```text
/login
```

Choose a provider, then follow the prompts to use a subscription or store an API key. Run `/model` afterward if you want to select a different available model.

See [Choose a model and provider](models.md) for supported providers, environment-variable authentication, local models, and custom endpoints.

## 4. Give Sly a task

Sly shows each file read, search, command, and edit it performs. It does not ask before every tool call.

Enter a task that matches your work, for example:

```text
Summarize @meeting-notes.md and save the action items to action-items.md.
```

```text
Explain how this repository is structured and how to run its checks.
```

```text
Compare @previous.csv with @current.csv and summarize the important changes.
```

Type `@` in the editor to search for a file instead of entering its full path. When Sly finishes, review its response and any changed files. Use version control or backups for important work. For untrusted or unattended work, use a container or another sandbox. See [Security](security.md).

## Continue later

Sly saves sessions automatically. Exit Sly, then resume the most recent session for the same working folder with:

```bash
sly --continue
```

Use `/resume` to choose another saved session. See [Continue or branch a session](sessions.md) for session naming, branching, compaction, export, and sharing.

## Next steps

- [Use Sly interactively](usage.md) to learn input, commands, shortcuts, and queued messages.
- [Add instructions](configuration.md#context-files) that Sly should follow whenever it works in a folder.
- [Choose a model and provider](models.md).

### Choose how to customize Sly

Start with the least powerful mechanism that meets your need:

| Need | Start with |
|---|---|
| Give Sly persistent instructions for a folder | [`AGENTS.md`](configuration.md#context-files) |
| Reuse a prompt from the `/` menu | [Prompt template](prompt-templates.md) |
| Add task-specific instructions and supporting files | [Skill](skills.md) |
| Add executable tools, commands, or event handlers | [Extension](extensions.md) |
| Build a custom terminal component | [Terminal UI](tui.md) |
| Connect an unsupported model service | [Custom provider](custom-provider.md) |
| Install or distribute several resources | [Sly package](packages.md) |

## Uninstall Sly

If you installed Sly with npm, run:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

If you used the installer, run it again and choose **Uninstall Sly**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Neither method removes configuration, credentials, sessions, or installed Sly packages from `~/.sly/agent/`.
